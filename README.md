TITLE: "Mzumbe University Exam Attendance Management System, Using Biometric Fingerprint Scanner (MU-EAMS)"

Explanation About This Title:

In our University, there is an issue where students face difficulty signing attendance during the examination period. Therefore, I need to create a system that will assist a student in being able to sign their attendance when they take an exam. Specifically, they would sign "IN" when they enter and "OUT" when they exit through the use of fingerprint (Biometric). Additionally, if a student hasn't completed their tuition fee payment, they should not be able to sign "IN" and "OUT". Problem Statement:

Problem is difficult for students to sign their attendance (In and Out) during UE examinations. 
At Mzumbe university students face difficulty during signing attendance during exam time, and Mzumbe university face problems because sometimes one student can attend an exam of another student which may lead to discontinuity of student after being arrested. The traditional methods of managing examination attendance at Mzumbe University involve manual processes, including paper-based sign-in sheets, which are prone to errors, time-consuming, and susceptible to identity fraud. The current system lacks an efficient and secure means of accurately recording and verifying student attendance during examinations, leading to challenges such as inaccurate attendance records and potential academic dishonesty. Therefore this system can help Mzumbe university to easily store student exams attendance and to reduce the number of student discontinuity. The System can be used through the use of fingerprint (Biometric) in which students may sign in and sign out, so no student which can share fingerprint with another student(s).

Objectives of the System: The proposed Examination Attendance Management System aims to address the existing challenges and improve the overall efficiency, accuracy, and security of the attendance tracking process at Mzumbe University. The specific objectives are:

a. Automated Attendance Recording: Develop a system that automatically records and verifies student attendance during examinations using fingerprint scanning technology.

b. Identity Verification: Implement a secure mechanism for accurately verifying the identity of students through their unique fingerprints, minimising the risk of attendance fraud.

c. Real-time Monitoring: Provide real-time monitoring capabilities for examination administrators to track attendance progress, identify absentees, and take immediate actions if necessary.

d. Data Accuracy: Ensure the accuracy of attendance records by eliminating manual data entry errors and reducing the likelihood of proxy attendance.

e. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both administrators and students to facilitate easy interaction with the system.

Proposed Solution:

Main objective of this system is to make easy signing of exam attendance and store records for exam attendance at Mzumbe university electronically, also To avoid cheating in exams whereby no student can attend another student, because the system can use fingerprint biometric scanner for attendance. The proposed Examination Attendance Management System will leverage state-of-the-art fingerprint scanning technology to automate the attendance tracking process. The system will consist of the following key components:

a. Fingerprint Scanner Integration: Integrate fingerprint scanners at examination venues to capture and verify students' fingerprints during the sign-in process.

b. Database Management System: Implement a secure and centralised database to store and manage student information, attendance records, and other relevant data.

c. Real-time Communication Module: Develop a real-time communication module to enable instant updates on attendance status for both administrators and students.

d. User Interfaces: Design user-friendly interfaces for administrators to monitor and manage attendance, and for students to easily register their attendance using fingerprint scans.

e. Security Protocols: Implement encryption, access controls, and other security measures to safeguard the system from unauthorised access and data breaches.

Therefore By achieving these objectives, the proposed system will revolutionise the examination attendance management process at Mzumbe University, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and overall security.
